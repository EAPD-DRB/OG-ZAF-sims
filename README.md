# OG-ZAF Simulations and Reforms
This repository contains the run scripts, data, and descriptions of simulations and reforms that use the OG-ZAF model. The repository for the OG-ZAF model is https://github.com/EAPD-DRB/OG-ZAF. It can also be downloaded and installed from the Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/project/ogzaf/) using the `pip install ogzaf` command.

The reforms in this repository are stored in the `./simulations/` folder. Each subfolder represents a particular set of simulations and reforms associated with a specific experiment. At a minimum, each subfolder contains a run script for the corresponding simulation. They should also contain a `README.md` file that explains what the experiment was and how the files relate to each other. Each subfolder might also contain slides, papers, or other presentation materials associated with the simulation.
